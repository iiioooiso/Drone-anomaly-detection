# Drone-anomaly-detection
Methodology for building a predictive anomaly detection system for drone flight paths, leveraging a hybrid AI model combining LSTM Autoencoders and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithms. The approach focuses on real-time detection of critical flight anomalies such as sensor malfunctions, signal jamming, and unauthorized diversions.
